[TOC]

## Story

As a user (whether or not I am logged in) I should be able to use the main "Movies" page to view or search through the list of movies.

-   IDs are links to individual movie records.
-   Name and Overview fields are searchable.
-   I can filter by Production Company.
-   I can sort by all columns.

### Technical Acceptance Criteria

There are LOTS of ways to test this page. Data driven testing is highly recommended.

Include at LEAST the following.

-   Searching by Name
-   Filtering by Production Company
-   Sorting columns with and without searches/filters
-   Clearing searches/filters re-populates movies.

## General Instructions

This step is the capstone of the certification. At this point, you should be able to figure out how to implement these tests, using a little bit of everything.

-   Interacting with different types of elements
-   Abstraction
-   Data Driven Testing
-   Etc.

You shouldn't get fully exhastive with this step, but do make sure to include a lot of different tests!

## Keep In Mind

> **Make It Your Own**
>
> Different people use different styles, different processes, different tools. If we were all of us working on the same team, same project, etc. we should spend the time to coordinate our efforts.
>
> This is an opportunity for you to experiment and try things out on your own. So long as you do your best to keep your automation clean and maintainable, it doesn't need to look exactly like everyone else's. Do it the way you want!
>
> This doesn't always mean your way is the best way; be open to feedback, recognize where it wasn't efficient, or something else might have been easier, but **keep going**. It's better to have decent automation covering an application than having the PERFECT setup that only covers a small portion of the app.

## Language/Framework Specific Instructions

-   There are none -- you should be ready to go by now; review previous steps if you need a hand with something specific.
-   As always, remember you can reach out to us with questions!

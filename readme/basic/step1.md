# Step 1 - Task: Initialize Framework

[TOC]

## Summary

This task is all about setting up for automation. Sometimes choosing a framework can be more arduous than executing basic testing; remember, it's almost always better to move forward with a slightly-less-than-perfect solution than to spend the extra hours getting it _just_ right.

## Technical Acceptance Criteria

-   You are able to execute a simple test on your machine.
-   Preferably your framework is set up such that it will execute at least on a Mac or a PC.

## General Instructions

1. In the repository you forked/cloned, add a new folder at the base of the project: `/automation/`
1. Your task is to set up a basic test (like checking Google's page title) to make sure your automation is working. Make sure to include an assertion.
    - **Language agnostic advice:** It may be worth downloading your Drivers (ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver, etc.) to a file on your system's path, where you can update them for ALL of your projects simultaneously.
1. Further instructions to set up basic automation will be language specific -- look in the section of this file for your specific certification.

As you work, you'll want to commit and push your code OFTEN; this will make it less likely you'll lose work, and easier to go back to a previous version if something is broken.

## Keep In Mind

> **There is no "Right Answer"** when it comes to automation. From language to process, everyone tends to develop their own preferences -- and while our clients have often made those decisions already, we want you to use this certification to find/exercise _your_ preferences. Generally, use the instructions from here on out as guidelines.
>
> Want to use a separate test runner that we don't list?
>
> -   Go for it!
>
> Know how to get something done in a slightly different way?
>
> -   Give it a try. Just don't be surprised if we ask about it/give feedback.

> **Setup is usually the most painful part.**
>
> Seriously. There's a reason developers generally HATE swapping dev environments, and if you haven't learned the same love of setting up an environment, you will!
>
> Don't get upset if it takes some tweaking or iterating to get things working. Every computer is different, and often needs a slightly different configuration for ANY coding.

> **Be the Squeaky Wheel**
>
> There is a lot to be said for trying to figure things out yourself. And not all of it is good! Our ask is that when (not if) you get stuck:
>
> -   Don't spin your wheels for long.
> -   Use your resources -- Google error messages, hit Stack Overflow, try different things out.
> -   If you've tried a few things without it working, ASK. That's what the `#qaCert` channel exists for, you have peers and leaders who enjoy helping.
>     -   We _do_ have clients though, so be patient, and willing to tag people/or remind us you're stuck.

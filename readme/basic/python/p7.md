## Summary

Your task here is basically building on the previous step. You'll need to read in data from a file, and then iterate over that data in your test.

## Importing from a data file

There are several tools that ship with Python to handle reading from files. We'll utilize a JSON file and read that into our test. This can be done directly in the test, but we'll utilize a pytest fixture such that the data can be used across multiple test more easily.

1. Create a `dataFiles` folder.
1. Add an `__init__.py` file to the folder to register the folder as a package. This makes file imports MUCH easier.
1. Add a data file to the new folder.
    * **`dataFiles/companies.json`**
        ```json
        {
            "companies": [
                {
                    "company": "Alfreds Futterkiste",
                    "contact": "Maria Anders",
                    "country": "Germany"
                },
                {
                    "company": "Centro comercial Moctezuma",
                    "contact": "Francisco Chang",
                    "country": "Mexico"
                },
                {
                    "company": "Ernst Handel",
                    "contact": "Roland Mendel",
                    "country": "Austria"
                },
                {
                    "company": "Island Trading",
                    "contact": "Helen Bennett",
                    "country": "UK"
                },
                {
                    "company": "Laughing Bacchus Winecellars",
                    "contact": "Yoshi Tannamuri",
                    "country": "Canada"
                },
                {
                    "company": "Magazzini Alimentari Riuniti",
                    "contact": "Giovanni Rovelli",
                    "country": "Italy"
                }
            ]
        }
        ```
1. Add a new fixture to your `conftest.py`, but not an autouse fixture this time.
1. You will also need to `import json` in your `conftest.py`.

Now we can open the `companies.json` file, parse it, and return the array of companies to any test method using the fixture.

**`companyList` fixture**
```python
@pytest.fixture()
def companyList():
    f = open("dataFiles/companies.json")
    data = json.load(f)
    return data["companies"]
```

## Using a fixture

Accessing this data from our test is simple. From any test method, add the name of the fixture as an argument.

I created a test that brings in this data below.

**`tests/test_fromDataFile.py`**
```python
from pages.w3tables import TablePage

class TestFromDataFile:
    # pytest sees the fixture called companyList, and passes it into the test.
    def test_fromFile(self, companyList):
        page = TablePage(self.driver, self.wait)
        page.getPage()
        assert len(companyList) == len(page.getCustomerRows())
```

## Iteration

### Iteration via for loop

As you can see in the last two lines of my updated test, adding iteration based upon this data is simple. The test activity is nested into the `for company in companyList` loop.

**`tests/test_fromDataFile.py`**
```python
from pages.w3tables import TablePage

class TestFromDataFile:
    def test_fromFile(self, companyList):
        page = TablePage(self.driver, self.wait)
        page.getPage()
        assert len(companyList) == len(page.getCustomerRows())
        # The iteration starts here - each company in the data file should 
        # be displayed as expected on the page.
        for company in companyList:
            assert page.getCustomerRowByCompany(company["company"]) == company
```

### Iteration via Parametization

The steps to use pytest's parametization to iterate over our company list are only slightly different. Parametizing a fixture automatically parametizes any test that depends on that fixture. The kicker is that paremetizing occurs before fixtures are defined, so we need to adjust our fixture a bit since we can't use one fixture to parametize another... You should see what I mean in a moment.

#### Parametization Example

**`companyData` fixture**
```python
@pytest.fixture(params=[{
            "company": "Alfreds Futterkiste",
            "contact": "Maria Anders",
            "country": "Germany"
        },
        {
            "company": "Centro comercial Moctezuma",
            "contact": "Francisco Chang",
            "country": "Mexico"
        },
        {
            "company": "Ernst Handel",
            "contact": "Roland Mendel",
            "country": "Austria"
        }])
def companyData(request):
    return request.param
```
* Here we have a hardcoded list of companies. As params, they are iterated over automatically by pytest, meaning the `companyData` fixture gets them one at a time, and any test depending on `companyData` is executed once per each item.

Now, we need our test to take one company at a time to verify it.

**`test_fromDataFile.py`**
```python
from pages.w3tables import TablePage

class TestFromDataFile:
    def test_fromFile(self, companyData):
        page = TablePage(self.driver, self.wait)
        page.getPage()
        assert page.getCustomerRowByCompany(companyData["company"]) == companyData
```
* My output from this test is as follows:
    ```
    ========================= 3 passed in 12.90s ========================= 
    ```
    * 3 tests, even though we only have one fixture and one test file.
    * This only works because we have 3 params going into the fixture.

**BUT** this is only a partial solution. We don't want to hard code our data -- that's why we have a test file.

#### Parametization without hard coding data

To get the full solution, all we need is to have a function that will read the file and return the list of companies. If we call that function as we define the fixture, it will define our parameters for us!

**`companyData` fixture**
```python
def getCompanyList():
    # not defined as a fixture, won't be imported into tests
    f = open("dataFiles/companies.json")
    data = json.load(f)
    return data["companies"]

# we can use functions already defined or imported in our fixture declaration!
@pytest.fixture(params=getCompanyList())
def companyData(request):
    return request.param
```

I'd probably want to rework this test a bit so that the page load happened at the class level, instead of waiting for the page to reload between every test, but this still works...
```
========================= 6 passed in 25.82s ========================= 
```

#### Execution

If you parametize your tests this way, you can see each test that pytest "finds" by adding the flag `-v` to your execution command.


**`$`**` python -m pytest -v tests/test_fromDataFile.py`

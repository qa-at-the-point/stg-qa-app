## Summary

Logging in using a function is a basic part of most automation setups; after all, it's something we need to do all the time in our applications.

The following example of adding a search function to a test should show how you might add a login function to your test file.

### Simple Example

We'll need to

1. Add a function.
2. Update our test.
3. Split the tests
    - It's far more effective to have multiple small tests running vs. one bigger test. This example is tiny, but we can still start practicing breaking up our tests sooner rather than later using a `fixture` to handle setup and teardown between tests.
4. Define our fixture

#### 1. Defining The function:

(I put this at the bottom of my file)

```python
def search(search_term, driver):
    driver.find_element(By.NAME, "q").send_keys(search_term)
    # Our explicit wait-er can handle things the implicit wait can't handle well...
    wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10)
    # There are two "Google Search" buttons on the page -- one that's visible when you first load the page.
    # The other only shows up when the autocomplete box pops open, which also blocks the other button.
    # We'll wait until the search button on the popout is present and visible, and then click it.
    wait.until(EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.XPATH, "(//*[@name='btnK'])[1]"))).click()
    # Now we'll wait until the element CANNOT be located before we continue with our test.
    # (Not that we NEED to for this test necessarily)
    wait.until_not(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.XPATH, "(//*[@name='btnK'])")))
```

Some things to notice:

-   I'll need to pass in the `driver` we use in the test, as well as the search term, so that the function knows how to interact with my browser.

-   The search button on the little suggestions popout is present on the page from the getgo, but hidden, so we explicitly wait until it's present and visible to click it.
    -   I imported the `expected_conditions` library as `EC`, since it's easier to type that way (see the whole file below)

#### 2. Updating The Test:

```python
def test_google_title():
    # Get our driver/browser object
    driver = selenium.webdriver.Chrome()
    # The implicit wait handles most waits.
    driver.implicitly_wait(10)
    # Go to Google
    driver.get("https://www.google.com")
    # Check the title
    assert "Google" in driver.title
    # Verify the initial "I'm Feeling Lucky" button.
    lucky_button = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "btnI")
    assert lucky_button.get_attribute("value") == "I'm Feeling Lucky"
    # Do our search
    search("Puppy", driver)
    # Check results
    assert "Puppy" in driver.find_element(By.ID, "rso").text
    # Close the driver
    driver.quit()
```

-   I just extended the first test here, called the search function, checked the results element, and we're done. You can run and verify this.

#### 3. Splitting The Tests

1. This is a little involved, unless you want to write up your the setup for each and every test. We're going to pull that setup out into a pytest fixture. Don't forget you'll need to `import pytest` in your test file!

    ```python
    # this decoractor tells pytest that we'll use this fixture automatically in every test.
    @pytest.fixture(scope="function", autouse=True)
    def chrome_init(request):
        # the `request` argument lets us get info about the test, and pass things TO the test.
        driver = selenium.webdriver.Chrome()
        driver.implicitly_wait(10)
        wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10)
        # we've set up our driver, our implicit and explicit waits, then we can add them to the "request" that gets passed to the test.
        request.cls.driver = driver
        request.cls.wait = wait
        # now we can load our page
        driver.get("https://www.google.com")
        # the yield waits while the test is running
        yield
        # then after the test, we close the browser
        driver.quit()
    ```

    - This fixture is automatically used in every test function.
    - We could actually move this fixture out of our test file and have it impact multiple test files!

1. Now, we need to have a test class for our test functions, so that it can consume the fixture correctly.
1. And in that class we can have our test or tests!

    ```python
    # We need the class for us to be able to pass properties from the fixture into the test easily on the `self` parameter.
    class TestGoogle:
        def test_google_title(self):
            # Check the title
            assert "Google" in self.driver.title
            # Verify the initial "I'm Feeling Lucky" button.
            lucky_button = self.driver.find_element(By.NAME, "btnI")
            assert lucky_button.get_attribute("value") == "I'm Feeling Lucky"

        def test_google_search(self):
            # Do our search
            search("Puppy", self.driver)
            # Check results
            assert "Puppy" in self.driver.find_element(By.ID, "rso").text
    ```

    - Note, the added tab for python to know the functions are in the class...
    - Also, the `self` parameter passed into each test that has the properties we defined in the fixture on `request.cls` -- this actually refers to the test class the fixture is loaded into. Works nicely!

    ```
    ===== 2 passed in 20.03s =====
    ```

#### 4. The Whole Test File

Just for your reference this is what the end piece looks like...

```python
import pytest
import selenium.webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

# this decoractor tells pytest that we'll use this fixture automatically in every test.
@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def chrome_init(request):
    # the `request` argument lets us get info about the test, and pass things TO the test.
    driver = selenium.webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.implicitly_wait(10)
    wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10)
    # we've set up our driver, our implicit and explicit waits, then we can add them to the "request" that gets passed to the test.
    request.cls.driver = driver
    request.cls.wait = wait
    # now we can load our page
    driver.get("https://www.google.com")
    # the yield waits while the test is running
    yield
    # then after the test, we close the browser
    driver.quit()

# We need the class for us to be able to pass properties from the fixture into the test easily on the `self` parameter.
class TestGoogle:
    def test_google_title(self):
        # Check the title
        assert "Google" in self.driver.title
        # Verify the initial "I'm Feeling Lucky" button.
        lucky_button = self.driver.find_element(By.NAME, "btnI")
        assert lucky_button.get_attribute("value") == "I'm Feeling Lucky"

    def test_google_search(self):
        # Do our search
        search("Puppy", self.driver)
        # Check results
        assert "Puppy" in self.driver.find_element(By.ID, "rso").text


def search(search_term, driver):
    driver.find_element(By.NAME, "q").send_keys(search_term)
    # Our explicit wait-er can handle things the implicit wait can't handle well...
    wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10)
    # There are two "Google Search" buttons on the page -- one that's visible when you first load the page.
    # The other only shows up when the autocomplete box pops open, which also blocks the other button.
    # We'll wait until the search button on the popout is present and visible, and then click it.
    wait.until(EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.XPATH, "(//*[@name='btnK'])[1]"))).click()
    # Now we'll wait until the element CANNOT be located before we continue with our test.
    # (Not that we NEED to for this test necessarily)
    wait.until_not(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.XPATH, "(//*[@name='btnK'])")))
```

## Summary

We have here a story about viewing and editing a record. We also have our acceptance criteria about all of the different places the information (original or edited) should be visible, so designing tests to meet this criteria should be pretty simple.

Coding your tests should also be fairly straightforward, given that you will be using actions you have already utilized.

-   Navigating between pages
-   Getting text from elements
-   Clearing/Setting inputs
-   Clicking buttons

Don't forget you do need to abstract shared functionality from your tests.

-   Create multiple page objects to house your functionality
-   Use functions/objects with methods to house your functionality

We haven't worked much with a table just yet, and that might look complicated, but it chunks out to the following tasks:

1. Get the rows in your table
1. Find the row with the correct value in the correct column
1. Verify the other cells in that row match the values we'd expect
1. etc.

To show how this works, I've created a page object that does various things with a table, and written some tests against it.

### Simple Table Example

We'll use the table in W3School's [HTML Tables](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp) page to show the types of functionality you'll need in order to complete testing this story.

See the comments around each function/test for some additional things to note.

#### pages/w3tables.py

```python
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

class TablePage:
    customerTable = (By.ID, "customers")
    url = "https://w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp"

    def __init__(self, driver, wait):
        self.driver = driver
        self.wait = wait

    def getPage(self):
        self.driver.get(self.url)
        self.wait.until(EC.visibility_of_element_located(self.customerTable))

    def getCustomerTable(self):
        return self.driver.find_element(*self.customerTable)

    def getCustomerRows(self):
        # I usually don't add page properties for simple tags like "tr" or "td".
        rows = self.getCustomerTable().find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "tr")
        # The `list.pop()` method removes the indicated row.
        # We're removing the first row since it's the table header.
        # Often, you can find rows by `tbody > tr`, but this table put the header row in the body.
        rows.pop(0)
        return rows

    def getCustomerRowByCompany(self, company):
        # Iterating over each element in a list is pretty simple
        for row in self.getCustomerRows():
            # Remember you can find elements from other elements too
            cells = row.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "td")
            if cells[0].text==company:
                # Here we are returning a new "disctionary" of mapped
                # key/value pairs, this one with the row's contents.
                return {
                    "company":company,
                    "contact":cells[1].text,
                    "country":cells[2].text
                }

    def getUniqueCountries(self):
        countries = []
        # In this function, we're checking the country in each row. If it is not
        # already in our list of countries, we are adding it, then returning the
        # entire list.
        for row in self.getCustomerRows():
            currentCountry = row.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "td")[2].text
            if currentCountry not in countries:
                countries.append(currentCountry)
        return countries
```

#### tests/test_table.py

```python
from pages.w3tables import TablePage


class TestTable:
    def test_printingTableText(self):
        page = TablePage(self.driver, self.wait)
        page.getPage()
        # add `-s` to the pytest command to see print output on a successful test
        print(page.getCustomerTable().text)

    def test_findingARow(self):
        page = TablePage(self.driver, self.wait)
        page.getPage()
        # accessing a property of a dictionary in python requres square brackets
        # and the name of the property.
        assert page.getCustomerRowByCompany("Ernst Handel")["contact"] == "Roland Mendel"

    def test_gettingUniqueRows(self):
        page = TablePage(self.driver, self.wait)
        page.getPage()
        expectedCountries = [
            "Austria",
            "Canada",
            "Germany",
            "Italy",
            "Mexico",
            "UK",
        ]
        displayedCountries = page.getUniqueCountries()
        assert len(expectedCountries) == len(displayedCountries)
        for country in expectedCountries:
            assert country in displayedCountries
```

#### Some things to notice:

Don't stress if this takes you a bit longer: you are applying processes you've used before, sure, but this application is a bit different, and longer.

### Execute

Run these tests (showing the printed content for the first test) with the command: `python -m pytest -s tests/test_table.py`.

This will run ONLY your test_table test, instead of all the test files in your tests folder. The `-s` flag on the pytest command will also show instead of supressing the `print()` commands in your tests.

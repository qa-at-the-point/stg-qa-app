## Summary

Python is fairly intuitive when it comes to importing things from other files.

Here you'll just move your function to a different file and reuse it. We'll also show you moving your fixture into a separate file as well, where all of your tests can use it.

### Simple Example

Here we add some new files, copy some content out of `test_google.py` and add an import line. That's it!

#### `search.py`

To bring your search function into a new file:

1. Add a new file in the directory.
2. Cut and paste the function.
3. Add the appropriate import statment(s) at the top of the file.

**search.py**

```python
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

def search(search_term, driver):
    driver.find_element(By.NAME, "q").send_keys(search_term)
    # Our explicit wait-er can handle things the implicit wait can't handle well...
    wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10)
    # There are two "Google Search" buttons on the page -- one that's visible when you first load the page.
    # The other only shows up when the autocomplete box pops open, which also blocks the other button.
    # We'll wait until the search button on the popout is present and visible, and then click it.
    wait.until(EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.XPATH, "(//*[@name='btnK'])[1]"))).click()
    # Now we'll wait until the element CANNOT be located before we continue with our test.
    # (Not that we NEED to for this test necessarily)
    wait.until_not(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.XPATH, "(//*[@name='btnK'])")))
```

#### conftest.py

This is a special file used by pytest - it will read this file to use fixtures across all of our tests.

1. Create the `conftest.py` file in the same directory as your test file(s).
2. Cut/paste your fixture into it.
3. Update your import statements.

**conftest.py**

```python
import pytest
import selenium.webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait

# this decoractor tells pytest that we'll use this fixture automatically in every test.
@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def chrome_init(request):
    # the `request` argument lets us get info about the test, and pass things TO the test.
    driver = selenium.webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.implicitly_wait(10)
    wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10)
    # we've set up our driver, our implicit and explicit waits, then we can add them to the "request" that gets passed to the test.
    request.cls.driver = driver
    request.cls.wait = wait
    # now we can load our page
    driver.get("https://www.google.com")
    # the yield waits while the test is running
    yield
    # then after the test, we close the browser
    driver.quit()
```

#### test_google.py

Your test file itself is getting pretty sparse now!

1. You can delete any and all unused imports (these are "grayed out" generally by your IDE)
1. You will need to add an import statement for the serach function.
    - `from {filename} import {itemname}` is the format, and we'll use `search` for our `search.py` filename, and `search` is also the name of our function.

**test_google.py**

```python
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from search import search # super easy import statement here!


# We need the class for us to be able to pass properties from the fixture into the test easily on the `self` parameter.
class TestGoogle:
    def test_google_title(self):
        # Check the title
        assert "Google" in self.driver.title
        # Verify the initial "I'm Feeling Lucky" button.
        lucky_button = self.driver.find_element(By.NAME, "btnI")
        assert lucky_button.get_attribute("value") == "I'm Feeling Lucky"

    def test_google_search(self):
        # Do our search
        search("Puppy", self.driver)
        # Check results
        assert "Puppy" in self.driver.find_element(By.ID, "rso").text

```
